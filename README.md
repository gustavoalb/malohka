This personal project was an excercise of how technology could improve the students
life in a Technical School. It was applied in the Federal Institute of Amapá. 
It managed event/courses/study group applications and excercises, certificates, issued
and controlled the validity of student ids, shared news about the institute and tech in general,
school/study group/minicourses attendance control and reporting about all those activities.
Its biggest use case was in the National Science and Technology Week 2015.
Deactivated for lack of personel/time to mantain and operate.
